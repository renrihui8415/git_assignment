Issues typically contain information such as a title, description, labels, assignees and comments. It serves a organizational role in software development workflows. Pull requests (PRs) are often linked to specific issues, which ensures transparency, traceability, and alignment development tasks and code changes.
b. What is a pull request?
- A pull request (PR) is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another. In a pull request, collaborators can review and discuss the proposed set of changes before they integrate the changes into the main codebase.
